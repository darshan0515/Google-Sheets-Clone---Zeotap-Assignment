# Google Sheets Clone - Zeotap Assignment

## Overview  
This is a web application mimicking the core functionalities and user interface of Google Sheets. Developed as part of Zeotap's software engineering intern assignment, the project implements a spreadsheet interface with support for mathematical functions, data quality checks, and user interactions.

## Features  

### 1. Spreadsheet Interface  
- **Google Sheets-like UI**: Toolbar, formula bar, and grid-based structure.  
- **Drag and Drop**: Seamless content dragging for cells and formulas.  
- **Dynamic Cell Updates**: Automatic recalculation of dependent cells.  
- **Basic Formatting**: Options for bold, italics, font size, and color.  
- **Row/Column Operations**: Add, delete, and resize rows or columns.

### 2. Mathematical Functions  
- **SUM**: Computes the sum of a range of cells.  
- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of a range of cells.  
- **MAX**: Finds the maximum value in a range.  
- **MIN**: Finds the minimum value in a range.  
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of numeric cells in a range.

### 3. Data Quality Functions  
- **TRIM**: Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.  
- **UPPER/LOWER**: Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.  
- **REMOVE_DUPLICATES**: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.  
- **FIND_AND_REPLACE**: Searches and replaces text within a range.

### 4. Data Entry and Validation  
- **Data Input**: Supports numbers, text, and dates.  
- **Validation**: Ensures numeric cells only accept numbers.

### 5. Bonus Features  
- **Save and Load**: Users can save and reload their spreadsheets.  
- **Data Visualization**: Create charts and graphs from spreadsheet data.  
- **Formula Support**: Handles relative and absolute references.
